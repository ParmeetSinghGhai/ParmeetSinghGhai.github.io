The application has the option to add both remote drives (google drives) and local drives so files and folders can be synced in between them. There is no limit to the number of 
drives that can be added into the application. Following are the steps needed to be followed in order to add a remote drive (google drive) into the application.

        <p>A new drive row should populate in the drives list. Now we need to select a license for this drive and also assign it a unique name.</p>

<tr>
    <td>
        <p>4</p>
    </td>
    <td>
        <p>Assign a new name to this drive and select a license for it using the license drop down list. The name of the license shown in the drop down list 
        is the email address of the google drive account for which the license was installed for.<br/>
        When these two details have been provided then go ahead and click on "Save Drive" either on the control bar or the right click menu and that should save 
        the drive in the application.

        <p>Please verify that the drive is saved by reviewing system messages.After the drive is saved then almost all of its properties including the name that you assigned to it
            will become uneditable. If you would like to change the drive's name then please go ahead and delete this drive and add the same drive with the same license but different
            name.
