           Creating a new file or folder works quite the same as it does in any windows operating system. This option is only available in "Files" window browse mode.
           Following are the steps needed to be performed in order to create a new file or folder
        <p/>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>1</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                        This option is only available for folders so you need to first right click on the folder in which you would 
                        like the new file or folder to show up at and that should bring up various file and folder operation among them 
                        will be "New". Please click on "New" and then either "File" or "Folder" depending on what you want to create.
                    </p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="../assets/img/filesbrowse/newfilefolder1.png">
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>2</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                        When you click on "File" or "Folder" in the previous step then that will bring up a pop up window asking you to 
                        provide the name of the new file or folder. This is where you type in the new name and click on "Create New File" or 
                        "Create New Folder".
