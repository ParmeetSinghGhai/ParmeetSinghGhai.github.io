            party service from <a href="http://checkip.dyndns.org">http://checkip.dyndns.org</a>. This IP Address is then sent to two other 3rd party services 
            namely <a href = "http://proxycheck.io">http://proxycheck.io</a> and <a href = "https://ipinfo.io">https://ipinfo.io</a>

           A web browser window should open up next asking you to sign in with your google account to continue with PSGDriveSync application.<br/><br>Before you proceed further with
           the sign in process, may go ahead and follow the next step first even though its totally optional. The next step helps with making sure that your google

           Copy the sign in link from the web browser window and paste it in the box labelled "Other url". The application will then compare this url to the sign in url that 
           is generated with the application. This makes sure that nobody else had sent you that sign url on your computer rather it was just PSGDriveSync application.<br/><br/>
           Doing so will help put your mind at ease knowing that you are logging into the right url.
