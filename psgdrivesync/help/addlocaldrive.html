The application has the option to add both remote drives (google drives) and local drives so files and folders can be synced in between them. There is no limit to the number of 
drives that can be added into the application. Following are the steps needed to be followed in order to add a local drive into the application.

        <p>A new drive row should populate in the drives list. For a local drive, there is no need to select a license which is why the license drop down list
        will be greyed out with a text showing "Not Required" however you do need to assign a name to the drive.<br/><br/>
        The "Add Local Drive" option will scan your computer for all the drives present on it including portable USB drives so you might see multiple drives 
        getting added to the drive list however you do not need to save all of them. You just to save the ones that you need for file and folder syncing.

            will become uneditable. If you would like to change the drive's name then please go ahead and delete this drive and add the same drive with the same license but different
            name.
