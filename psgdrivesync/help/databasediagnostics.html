            Database Connection Diagnostics basically checks if the application is able to properly access the database or not. This option can be run from the loading window and the main application window 
            as well. The process involves running a bunch of generic database commands on the application database and then generating the result of those commands on a log file which the end user can then 
            open to check the results of the diagnostics. The following are the steps needed to be performed in order to run database diagnostics

                        The content of the log file should show a bunch of Database commands along with the results associated with running those commands. All the commands should be saying "PASS" to indicate that there 
                        is no problem connecting to the database however if any one of them fail and give out an error message then you could try the following to resolve the problem
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Make sure that PSGDriveSync is not being blocked by an Anti Virus software application. 
                            </li>

                                Database file's read/write permissions are set correctly where most default system applications are able to access and read the file.<br/><br/>
