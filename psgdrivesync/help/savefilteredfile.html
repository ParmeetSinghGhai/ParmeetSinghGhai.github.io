            A filtered file can have its linked filters removed from it, new filters added to it and can have existing filters set as Inheritable or not Inheritable. After these 
            kind of changes are made to a filtered file then its needed to be Saved in order for these settings to take effect during sync operations. Following are the steps needed
            to be performed in order to save filtered files in the application.

                </td>

                    <p>
                       Select a filtered file in the list of filtered files in the "Filters" window. Doing so will make all its linked filters show up in the panel right next to it.

                       not Inheritable.
