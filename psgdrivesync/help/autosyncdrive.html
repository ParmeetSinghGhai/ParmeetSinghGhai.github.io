            AutoSync allows a drive saved in the application to be mounted automatically and have its sync operations started right after. This allows the drive to 
            sync its files and folders with other drives even though those drives themselves do not have "Auto Sync" enabled on them.<br/><br/>For example, If Drive A has been set to 
            sync its file "File A" with Drive B and Drive B has been set to sync its file "File B" with Drive A and "Auto Sync" has only been enabled on Drive A but not Drive B
            then the following actions will take place 
            <ul>
                <li>Drive A will be mounted automatically and its sync operations will start immediately</li>
                <li>Drive B will not be mounted and will remain idle</li>
                <li>Drive A will sync its file "File A" with Drive B so Drive B will end up having file "File A" from Drive A</li>
                <li>Drive B's file "File B" will remain on Drive B and will not sync to Drive A unless its sync operations are also started</li>
            </ul>

                        you can save the drive settings and the same should reflect in system messages.
