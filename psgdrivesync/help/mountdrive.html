            Mounting a drive involves fetching the root folder of a drive so all other files and folders contained within that drive can become ready for 
            real time file operations like cut,copy and paste or sync operations between this drive and some other drive.<br/><br/>
            Unmounting is the exact opposite of mounting a drive. it involves making the drive non operational for real time file operations and sync operations.
            If the drive was syncing while unmounting was initiated then the syncing will stop first and then the drive will become be unmounted.
