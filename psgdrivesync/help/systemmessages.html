                        Every tab or section of the application provides a system message window at the bottom of the section. The system message window is designed to keep user aware of any error messages 
                        related to current operation or in general the status of the operation that they initiated. It can be used to diagnose and resolve some of the issues that you might face with the 
                        application. There are three types of messages that the system messages window shows 
                    <p/>
                </td>
            </tr>
