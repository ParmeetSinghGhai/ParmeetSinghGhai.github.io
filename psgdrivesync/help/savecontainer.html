            Sync Items cannot exist on their own. They need to be linked to a Sync Container first in order to be Saved. Following are the steps needed to be followed in order to 
            Save Sync Items and Sync Containers in the Database.
        <p/>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>1</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                        Open the Drive in Sync Mode
                    </p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="../assets/img/filessync/savecontainer1.png">
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>2</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                        Select the Sync Container that you would like to Save. This will also populate all the Sync Items linked to that Sync Container.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Use the "Save" options under the Sync Container Control bar to save the entire Sync Container and all of its Sync Items or 
                        the "Save" options under the Sync Items Control bar to save just a few select Sync Items.
                    </p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="../assets/img/filessync/savecontainer2.png"><br/><br/><br/>

                </td>
            </tr>
