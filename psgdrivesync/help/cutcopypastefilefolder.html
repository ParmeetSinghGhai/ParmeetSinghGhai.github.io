           Doing a Cut, Copy, Paste on files and folders works quite the same as it does in any windows operating system. This option is only available in "Files" window browse mode.
           Following are the steps needed to be performed in order to create a new file or folder
        <p/>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>1</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                        Right click on any file or folder of your choosing and that should bring up various file and folder operations among them 
                        will be "Cut","Copy" and "Paste". First you need to click on either "Cut" or "Copy" depending on whether you would like to 
                        Move the selected file/folder or Copy the selected file/folder over to a some other folder.
                    </p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="../assets/img/filesbrowse/cutcopypaste1.png">
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>2</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                        Now you need to right click on any folder of your choosing, which is meant to contain the file / folder that you right 
                        clicked on in step 1, and click on "Paste".
                    </p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="../assets/img/filesbrowse/cutcopypaste2.png">
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>2</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                        If the destination folder belonged to some other drive than the source drive then you should see a popup window open 
                        up displaying the progress of moving or copying the file / folder over to its new destination folder. when the progress bar 
                        moves all the up way to 100% then you may go ahead and close that window. 
                    </p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="../assets/img/filesbrowse/cutcopypaste3.png">
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
