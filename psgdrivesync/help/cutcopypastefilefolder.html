           Doing a Cut, Copy, Paste on files and folders works quite the same as it does in any windows operating system. This option is only available in "Files" window browse mode.
           Following are the steps needed to be performed in order to create a new file or folder
        <p/>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>1</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                        Right click on any file or folder of your choosing and that should bring up various file and folder operations among them 
                        will be "Cut","Copy" and "Paste". First you need to click on either "Cut" or "Copy" depending on whether you would like to 
                        Move the selected file/folder or Copy the selected file/folder over to a some other folder.
                    </p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="../assets/img/filesbrowse/cutcopypaste1.png">
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>2</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                        Now you need to right click on any folder of your choosing, which is meant to contain the file / folder that you right 
                        clicked on in step 1, and click on "Paste".
                    </p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="../assets/img/filesbrowse/cutcopypaste2.png">
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>2</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                        If the destination folder belonged to some other drive than the source drive then you should see a popup window open 
                        up displaying the progress of moving or copying the file / folder over to its new destination folder. Once the file 
                        operation completes then you may go ahead and click on "Close" in the popup window.
                    </p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="../assets/img/filesbrowse/cutcopypaste3.png">
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>2</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                        Both the destination folder and the source file/folder's parent folder should reflect the changes in them due to this 
                        file/folder move/copy operation.<br/><br/> In case of copy operation, the source file/folder should show in both source file/folder
                        parent folder and the destination folder however if this was a move operation then the source file/folder will be removed 
                        from the source file/folder parent folder and will only show in the destination folder.
                    </p>
