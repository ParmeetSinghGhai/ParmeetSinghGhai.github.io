           Renaming files and folders works quite the same as it does in any windows operating system. This option is only available in "Files" window browse mode.
           Following are the steps needed to be performed in order to create a new file or folder
        <p/>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>1</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                        Right click on the file and folder that you would like to rename and then click on "Rename" in the right click menu.
                    </p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="../assets/img/filesbrowse/renamefilefolder1.png">
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>2</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                        A popup window should open up next asking for the new name for the selected file or folder. Provide a new name for the file/folder
                        and click on "Rename File" or "Rename Folder".
                    </p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="../assets/img/filesbrowse/renamefilefolder2.png">
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>2</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                        The new file or folder name should reflect on the selected file or folder.
                    </p>
                </td>
                <td>
