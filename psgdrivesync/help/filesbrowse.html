                        The "Files" window is where the majority of the work takes place in this application. The Files window functionality is split into two modes namely Browse Mode and 
                        Sync Mode<br/>

                    <p>
                        This mode allows the user to see drive properties namely total disk space, free disk space, used disk space and trash disk space. For google Drives
                        you also get to see user photo as well. Besides this you also get to see all the files and folders contained in the drive in a hierarchical tree like
                        structure.<br/>
                        The browse mode also allows you to perform the following real time file operations<br/>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Create New File & Folder</li>

                    <p>Sync Mode</p>
                    <p>
                        This mode allows the user to setup files and folders for automated sync operations and then start and stop these sync operations as well.
                        There are two main terminologies used to describe the things that files windows allows the user to do in this mode namely: Sync Containers and 
                        Sync Items.<br/>
                        Only Folders are referred to as Sync Containers while Files and Folders both can be referred to as Sync Items. Please keep this in mind these are 
                        just files and folders present on a drive however they are termed differently based on how you choose to look at them.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Sync Containers</p>
                                <p>
                                    Sync Containers are always Folders and never Files<br/>
                                    These are folders present on the Drive that you are currently viewing in the "Files" window either in the dock left position
                                    or the dock right position that you have setup for syncing. By default these folders acts as the destination for all the other files
                                    and folders from other drives
                                    which are being synced with this drive where those files and folders are referred to as Sync Items.<br/><br/> For example Drive A 
                                    has been setup to have Drive B's file "File B" synced to Drive A's Folder "Folder A". When the syncing completes then Drive A's Folder
                                    "Folder A" will contain Drive B's file "File B". If you mount and then dock Drive A in the "Files" window then "Folder A" will show
                                    as a Sync Container while "File B" will show as a Sync Item. 
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Sync Items</p>
                                <p>
                                    Sync Items can be both Files and Folders<br/>
                                    These are files and folders present on the Drive that you have set for syncing with some other drive where that some other drive is the 
                                    drive that you are currently viewing in the "Files" window. By default these files and folders act as the source for the Sync Container 
                                    that they are linked to from other drives.<br/><br/> For example Drive A has been setup to have Drive B's file "File B" synced to Drive A's
                                    Folder "Folder A". When the syncing completes then Drive A's Folder "Folder A" will contain Drive B's file "File B". If you mount and
                                    then dock
                                    Drive B in the "Files" window then neither "Folder A" or "File B" will show up in sync mode because a Sync Item is linked to a Sync Container
                                    and will only show along side its linked Sync Container. In this example, the Sync Container "Folder A" belongs to Drive A and Sync Item 
                                    "File B" is linked to Sync Container "Folder A" which is why these things will only show inside Drive A when you mount and dock Drive A in 
                                    Sync Mode.
