                        The application local database stores your google drive access token, refresh token along with paths of files and folders that you have set out 
                        for sync operations and most importantly the encryption keys used to encrypt your files among many other things. In order to add an extra layer of protection over 
                        your sensitive information, the entire database get encrypted with AES-256 encryption standard.Doing this makes sure that nobody except you gets to access the information 
                        that is saved in the application's local database.<br/><br/>



                        AES-256 encryption standard has been used to encrypt the entire database that stores your google drive access token, refresh token along with paths of files and folders that you have set out 
                        for sync operations and most importantly the encryption keys used to encrypt your files with among other things. Doing this makes sure that whatever data is saved in the application's local database remains safe and protected from intruders. The encryption key that is used to 
                        encrypt the entire database has been termed as "Master Key". The master key is not saved anywhere which means that if you lose or forget the key then your sync settings and other application 
                        database will become inaccessible and you wont be start the application. The only way out of this situation would be start over with a new database. Doing so will have no impact on the files 
                        and folders in your local and or remote (google) drives unless you had encrypted files in either or both drives since all encryptions key tags and keys are saved in the database for file and sync 
                        operations. 
                         
                         <br/><br/>Here is a quote from the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">Wikipedia pages</a>
                        on AES Encryption:<br/>
                        "The National Security Agency (NSA) reviewed all the AES finalists, including Rijndael, and stated that all of them were secure enough for U.S. Government non-classified data.
                        In June 2003, the U.S. Government announced that AES could be used to protect classified information:The design and strength of all key lengths of the AES algorithm (i.e., 128, 192 and 256)
                        are sufficient to protect classified information up to the SECRET level. TOP SECRET information will require use of either the 192 or 256 key lengths. The implementation of AES in products
                        intended to protect national security systems and/or information must be reviewed and certified by NSA prior to their acquisition and use."<br/><br/>
