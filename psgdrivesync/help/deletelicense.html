            Licenses can be deleted anytime should you choose not to use the application anymore. Removing a license not only removes your saved data from persistent 
            storage and local storage but also revokes your google access token and refresh token that the application uses to access your google drive files on your behalf. Doing so 
            will prevent the application from accessing your google drive account in the future unless you decide to add the license for your google drive back again. Following are 
            steps needed to be followed in order to delete a license
