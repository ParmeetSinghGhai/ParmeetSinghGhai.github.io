           "Switch To Browse" window allows you to switch to browse mode on the currently mounted and docked drive where you can view the drive information 
           along with all the files and folders contained in that drive in a tree like hierarchical structure. This is also the window where all the real 
           time file operations are performed on files and folders. Following are the steps needed to be performed in order to switch to browse more for a
           mounted and docked drive.
