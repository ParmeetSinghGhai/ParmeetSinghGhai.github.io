            The Properties windows the same as it does in most windows operation systems. It allows you to see some of the important properties related to a
            file or folder.
            
            <br/><br/>Following is a list of File properties which can be viewed under the properties window 
            <ul">
                <li>Drive that the file belongs to.</li>
                <li>Full name of the file.</li>
                <li>Path of the file. Path for local files is their absolute path while for google files its a unique alpha numeric code.</li>
                <li>Size of the file.</li>
                <li>Path of the parent folder which will be absolute path for local folder and alpha numeric code for google folder</li>
                <li>Last modified time.</li>
                <li>SHA256 hash of the contents of the file</li>
                <li>File resource is mostly used for google files to keep track of their sync status. Its a http link to the incomplete file on google servers 
                    which has yet to complete syncing. 
                </li>
                <li>Last write position is used to keep track of sync status for both local and remote files and represents the total number of bytes which have 
                    been synced so far.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Encryption status lets you know if a file is encrypted or not. If the encryption status shows "Encrypted" then clicking on "Show Encryption Information"
                    button will give out the following details 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Key tag is name of the encryption key used to encrypt this file</li>
                        <li>Iv is a unique series of bytes used in the encryption process and is used during the decryption process</li>
                        <li>Salt is a unique series of bytes used in the encryption process and is used during the decryption process</li>
                        <li>Hash salt is a unique series of bytes used in the hash generation process and is used during the decryption process but not 
                            to decrypt the file rather to verify the integrity of the file before it gets decrypted. so that ways files which have been 
                            compromised can be stopped from getting decrypted because they cause any damage.
                        </li>
                        <li>Hmac is the name of the file on the local machine that contains the hash of the all the byte chunks of a file. This file is 
                            used during the decryption process to verify the integrity of the file. The path of the local folder that contains all such files 
                            ,is listed in the file "Settings.json" under the settings "SignatureLocation".
                        </li>
                        <li>Final Padding is an encryption setting used during encrypting a file and is also used to decrypt the file.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br/>Following is a list of Folder properties which can be viewed under the properties window 
            <ul>
                <li>Drive that the folder belongs to.</li>
                <li>Full name of the folder.</li>
                <li>Path of the folder. Path for local folder is their absolute path while for google folders its a unique alpha numeric code.</li>
                <li>Size of the folder. This size is calculated by adding up the size of the files in this folders and files contained in its sub folders.</li>
                <li>Path of the parent folder which will be absolute path for local folder and alpha numeric code for google folder.</li>
                <li>Last modified time.</li>
            </ul>
            <br/><br/>Following are the steps needed to be performed in order to view properties of a file or folder.
