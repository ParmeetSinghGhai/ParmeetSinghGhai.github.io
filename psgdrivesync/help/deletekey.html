            An encryption key tag along with its encryption key can be deleted anytime however please do make sure that there are no encrypted file(s) using the encryption key tag that is about to be 
            deleted as that will make decrypting the file(s) impossible.<br/>
            if you end up accidentally deleting an encryption key tag in use then you would need to enter the same encryption tag again back in the application along 
            with the same encryption key that was used before to allow decryption of all those files linked to that encryption key tag.
