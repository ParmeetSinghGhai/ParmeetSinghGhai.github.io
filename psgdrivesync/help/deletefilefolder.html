           Deleting files and folders works quite the same as it does in any windows operating system. This option is only available in "Files" window browse mode.
           Following are the steps needed to be performed in order to create a new file or folder
        <p/>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>1</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                        If multiple files and folders are needed to be deleted then put a check mark on all those files and folders and right click on any 
                        one of the checked file and folder otherwise you may go ahead and straight away right click on the file or folder that you would like 
                        to delete. Doing so should bring up various file and folder operations and among them will be "Delete". Please click on "Delete".
                    </p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="../assets/img/filesbrowse/deletefilefolder1.png">
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>2</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                        A popup window should open up next asking for your confirmation on deletion of selected files/folders. Once you are ready 
                        you may go ahead and click on "Yes" in that popup window otherwise you may either click on "No" or simply close the popup window.
