                        <p>PSGDriveSync application is dependent on two main features without which the application will not work. Those features are namely Database and Internet Connection. Database is needed to 
                        store license information, drive information, file information, master key information and among many other things while internet connection is needed to download, manage and verify application 
                        license and to connect to google drive servers through which files and folders on end user's google drive are accessed.<br/><br/>
