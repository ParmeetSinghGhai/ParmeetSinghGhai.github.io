            "Filtered File" is a term used for any file or folder from a drive which has a filter(s) linked to it. A filter alone cannot take part in sync operations. In order 
            for filters to take effect, they are needed to be linked to filtered files. Following are the steps needed to be performed in order to add a filtered file in the 
            application.  
        <p/>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>1</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                       First you need to decide which drive do you intend to add filtered files from into the "Filters" window and then you need to mount and dock that drive 
                       in the "Files" window. Make sure that drive is in "Browse" mode.
                    </p>

                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>1</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                       You need to check all the files and folders that you would like to add to the "Filters" window as filtered file and then right click on any one of them or if its just
                       one file or folder that needs to be added as a filtered file then you can straight away right click on that file or folder. When the right click menu opens up then 
                       click on "Send To Filters Window".
