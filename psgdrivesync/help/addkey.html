            An encryption key tag is a unique identifier that is linked to the actual encryption key used to encrypt files. The encryption key tag is not secure information itself which is why its 
            important that the encryption key tag should not be the same as the encryption key itself or uses any other keyword that would disclose the encryption key itself. For Example, if you choose
            to use your birthday (not recommended) as the encryption key then the encryption key tag should be something like "My Special Key" or something of that nature instead of "My Birthday" or "
            The Password that I always Use" which could disclose the encryption key and compromise the security of your encrypted data.<br/>
            Following are the steps needed to be performed in order to add an encryption key tag with an encryption key into the application
        <p/>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>1</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                       Go to the "Encryption" window. 
                    </p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="../assets/img/encryption/addkey1.png">
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>2</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                       Click on the "Add Key" button and that should generate a new row in the list of encryption key tag which could be populated with encryption key tag and encryption key.
                       The same will reflect in the system messages as well.
                    </p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="../assets/img/encryption/addkey2.png">
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>3</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                       Enter the encryption key tag under the column "Key Name". As mentioned above this is not the actual encryption tag rather its a unique tag linked to the actual encryption 
                       key which helps in identification of the key itself. This is the reason why the key tag should not be the same as the encryption key nor should it contain any keywords which 
                       would compromise the key itself.
                    </p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="../assets/img/encryption/addkey3.png">
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>4</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                       Next we need to enter an encryption key. You can always click on the "visibility" icon right before the key value to make sure that you have typed the right encryption key.
                    </p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="../assets/img/encryption/addkey4.png" ><br/><br/><br/>
                    <img src="../assets/img/encryption/addkey5.png" >
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>5</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                       The final step is to save the encryption key tag by clicking on "Save". Once an encryption key tag has been saved then it cannot be changed but the encryption key itself, that
                       is linked to the encryption key tag, can always be modified.
                    </p>

                <td>

                </td>
            </tr>
