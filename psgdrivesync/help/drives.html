                        Drives window lets you add both remote drives (google drives) and local drives in the application. Without adding a drive for your google drive account 
                        or any of your local drive(s), you will not be able to work on any of the files and folders contained in those drives even though all of the application 
                        functionalities get enabled by adding a license for your google drive account. so the first step after adding a license should be to add drives.<br/><br/>
                        
                        Please go ahead and click on "Add Remote Drive" on the left to see how its done. As always thank you for using the application. We Appreciate it.
