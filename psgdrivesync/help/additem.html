            Sync containers are always folders while sync items can be both files and folders. These are just terminologies given to files and folders during sync operations
            to help control the sync operations. A Sync operations always exists between two drives. One drive will act as an destination while the other drive will act as a
            source. Files and folders get transferred from the source drive to a destination drive and sometimes, due to both ways syncing, from the destination drive to 
            source drive.<br/>
            No matter what the scenario is, only a folder can contain files and other folders which is why folders on the destination drives are termed as "Sync Containers" while 
            all other files and folders from the source drive are termed as "Sync Items". Sync Items themselves cannot exist on their own. They need a Sync Container to be linked
            to so they may exist linked to that sync container. If a sync container is deleted then its linked sync items are also deleted.<br/>
            Relationship between Sync Containers and Sync Items can be many to many which means that one Sync Container can contain multiple Sync Items and one Sync Item can be 
            linked to multiple Sync Containers.<br/>
            Sync Items can be added to an already existing Sync Container through the "Files" window Sync Mode and Browse Mode.
