            Licenses are needed to be downloaded when you have not deleted the license using the application however the license data was lost due to 
            events like reinstallation of the operation system or accidental deletion of the application files and data etc. In such situations, instead of 
            installing / adding a license all over again, the application provides a shortcut to getting the license back which is the option to 
            download an existing license. Following are the steps needed to be followed in order to download an existing license
        <p/>

        <table>

                       Copy the sign in link from the web browser window and paste it in the box labelled "Other url". The application will then compare this url to the sign in url that 
                       is generated with the application. This makes sure that nobody else had sent you that sign url on your computer rather it was just PSGDriveSync application.<br/><br/>
                       Doing so will help put your mind at ease knowing that you are logging into the right url.
