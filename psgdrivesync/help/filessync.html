                        The "Files" window is where the majority of the work takes place in this application. The Files window functionality is split into two modes namely Browse Mode and 
                        Sync Mode<br/>

                        This mode allows the user to see drive properties namely total disk space, free disk space, used disk space and trash disk space. For google Drives
                        you also get to see user photo as well. Besides this you also get to see all the files and folders contained in the drive in a hierarchical tree like
                        structure.<br/>
                        The browse mode also allows you to perform the following real time file operations<br/>

                            <li>Create New File & Folder</li>

                    <p>Sync Mode</p>
                    <p>
                        This mode allows the user to setup files and folders for automated sync operations and then start and stop these sync operations as well.
                        There are two main terminologies used to describe the things that "Files" windows allows the user to do in this mode namely: Sync Containers and 
                        Sync Items.<br/>
                        Sync containers are always folders while sync items can be both files and folders. These are just terminologies given to files and folders during sync operations
                        to help control the sync operations. A Sync operations always exists between two drives. One drive will act as the destination while the other drive will act as the
                        source. Files and folders get transferred from the source drive to a destination drive and sometimes, due to both ways syncing, from the destination drive to 
                        source drive.<br/>
                        No matter what the scenario is, only a folder can contain files and other folders which is why folders on the destination drives are termed as "Sync Containers" while 
                        all other files and folders from the source drive are termed as "Sync Items". Sync Items themselves cannot exist on their own. They need a Sync Container to be linked
                        to as a parent object. If a sync container is deleted then its linked sync items are also deleted.<br/>
                        Relationship between Sync Containers and Sync Items is of type many to many which means that one Sync Container can contain multiple Sync Items and one Sync Item can be 
                        linked to multiple Sync Containers.<br/>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Sync Containers</p>
                                <p>
                                    Sync Containers are always Folders and never Files<br/>
                                    These are folders present on the destination drive that acts as destination for files and folders from other drives during sync operations.
                                    <br/><br/> For example Drive A 
                                    has been setup to have Drive B's file "File B" synced to Drive A's Folder "Folder A". When the syncing completes then Drive A's Folder
                                    "Folder A" will contain Drive B's file "File B". If you mount and then dock Drive A in the "Files" window then "Folder A" will show
                                    as a Sync Container while "File B" will show as a Sync Item. 
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Sync Items</p>
                                <p>
                                    Sync Items can be both Files and Folders<br/>
                                    These are files and folders present on the source drive which act as source files and folders during sync operations.
                                    <br/><br/> For example Drive A has been setup to have Drive B's file "File B" synced to Drive A's
                                    Folder "Folder A". When the syncing completes then Drive A's Folder "Folder A" will contain Drive B's file "File B". If you mount and
                                    then dock Drive B in the "Files" window then neither "Folder A" or "File B" will show up in sync mode because a Sync Item is linked to a Sync Container
                                    and will only show along side its linked Sync Container. In this example, the Sync Container "Folder A" belongs to Drive A and Sync Item 
                                    "File B" is linked to Sync Container "Folder A" which is why these things will only show inside Drive A when you mount and dock Drive A in 
                                    Sync Mode.
